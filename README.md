# Bayesian Calibration of P. vivax Transmission Models

This repository contains the code required for my thesis and a publication manuscript.

# How to run

The `Rmd` folder contains a series of scripts that, when run, produce the required research artefacts. If using a computer cluster via SLURM, schedule the slurm_chapter_01/02.sh scripts instead.

Because some data were collected expressly for this research and are not publicly accessible, we include the necessary subset in `Rmd/china_data.rds`.
